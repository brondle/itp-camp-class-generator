Digital technologies allow us to create a control structure with computational predictability and precision. What happens, however, when designers begin to incorporate the self-determined internal control structure of a biological system as part of a design strategy? This course offers a new approach to materiality, positing that all matter is dynamic but exists within a continuum of control ranging from passively temporal (wood, water) to electronically active (photovoltaics, thermochromics) to biologically alive (plants, tissue). This course presents alternative design strategies for creating computational interfacing with living matter and state change of natural materials. Students are introduced to the world of the bio lab from a designer\u2019s perspective, both conceptually and practically. We examine the state-of-the-art in artistic experimentation with biological systems such as the genetic manipulation projects of Eduardo Kac, or the carbon nanotubes grown into architectural structures of Ryan Wartena. We also examine more DIY approaches to living systems integration and interactivity with biological systems. Students use a hands-on approach in their design process, with biological sensing as input and indicators or material state change as an alternative method of information display, for example. This course is designed to further our computational relationship with the natural world pushing forward ideas in sustainability, interactivity, energy production and the emerging relationship between the designer\/artist and the bio lab, approaching biology as an open frontier for digital design.","datetime_start":1275418800000,"datetime_end":1275418800000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2010,"id":430,"title":"Web Tech 101","description":"How do HTML, Javascript, CSS, Ajax, PHP, Ruby, MySQL, Flash, etc. all fit together in your web applications?

There will be snacks if anyone needs enticement besides the topic and the guests.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Dr. Sekai Chideya holds a MPH. She's worked for the Centers for Disease Control's Epidemic Intelligence Service and the New York City Department of Health, focused on AIDS and TB studies domestically and internationally. I have worked for companies including ABC, CNN, Newsweek, NPR; I'm now getting ready to pilot a new public radio\/digial program. Together she and I will talk about the different ways in which we have brokered honest discussions and gotten the best data given issues\/tensions of race and \u00a0diasporic identity between investigators\/interviewers and subjects. Working as a journalist (me, Farai) and as a public health researcher (Sekai) has brought us into contact with people who may be suspicious of us; overly deferential; or any number of emotional\/social relations that have to be worked through in order for us to do good work.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to having a conversation that deals not only with the African Diaspora communities, but also with the entire construct of the observer and the observed, and of data gathering in the field...\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nF\r\n\r\n======= former description ============\r\n\r\nVarious parts of the African diaspora, from urban American communities to vast stretches of rural areas throughout the Continent, are being used as spaces to experiment. That includes everything from crowdsourcing content; building new revenue-sharing models for assets from oil to wind; and performing public health interventions.\r\n\r\nInnovation is good, but\/and if there's a disconnect between innovators and community, you can have big problems. I'd like to give a personal and professional perspective on things I've learned from interacting with African diaspora communities; and things I've learned from being part of two different ones.\r\n\r\nI'm black American by birth and upbringing; my father was also Zimbabwean and I have a lot of ties in Southern Africa and go back every 3 years. I have shot some documentary footage in Zimbabwe and almost had it confiscated by the secret police. When I go into a low-income black community in the U.S., or an African-American celebrity event, or a gay black male social space, I am an insider in some ways, an outsider in others.\r\n\r\nI suspect some of you are exploring not only technology but the power relationship between \"observer\" and \"observed.\" (We are all observed, but not all document their observations publicly.) I think people who want to work either with Africanas or Afro-diasporic communities in the US (from black American to Haitian-American and even Cuban- and Puerto Rican-American) might want to have a conversation.\r\n\r\nMore on me at faraichideya.com","datetime_start":1275670800000,"datetime_end":1275764400000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2010,"id":1472,"title":"Sensors and Interface Board--Easy!","description":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Workshop Web Page: <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.elasticmind.com\/itp\"><strong>www.elasticmind.com\/itp<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\r\nHagstrom Electronics makes a wonderful interface board for about $70. that makes it really easy to plug input from almost any sensor into an existing or custom computer\u00a0program.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hagstromelectronics.com\/products\/kead6.html\">http:\/\/www.hagstromelectronics.com\/products\/kead6.html<\/a> This session will demonstrate how to use sensors and this board to input sensor data into a program you create, or an existing one.\u00a0 The board takes up to 6 sensors simultaneously, and outputs dynamic sensor values as keystrokes into the USB port.\u00a0 So, for example, your simple photocell is wired into channel 1, and you program the board to return keystrokes \"a\",\"b\",\"c \"and \"d\" depending on how much light the photocell \"sees\".\u00a0 Once programmed, the board monitors the photocell and sends back the corresponding keystroke when the light level changes.\u00a0 If you program the board to return keystrokes like the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) then the board can feed these keystrokes into any program that is expecting the user to hit these keys for control of an object.\u00a0 So it's really easy to retrofit an existing program or game to accept user input from sensors.\u00a0 Typical sensors that work include photocells, switches, Sharp IR distance ranging sensor, force sensors, pots, etc.\u00a0 I will bring a variety of sensors and some boards and we will program them.\u00a0 The board will function autonomously on either PC or Mac, but must be programmed on a PC.\u00a0 Once programmed with a configuration of keystrokes matching sensor values, the board can hold that program permanently (until you want to reprogram it for another project).\u00a0 This is a really easy and fun way to integrate sensors into your project without coding a more complex microcontroller.","datetime_start":1275505200000,"datetime_end":1275512400000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2010,"id":1644,"title":"UX: Rapid Application Prototyping for Mobile and Web","description":"So you have a fantastic idea for a mobile or web application.

The material could be shapes, colors, images of people, things, places, musical notes, sticks, stones, bones\u2014doesn't matter. If we think of art as a composition, either static or moving, then that composition comes into being through a process and at some point in the process takes the form of something people might call arresting, inspiring, moving, challenging, cool\u2014in other words an aesthetic artifact.\r\n\r\nAfter a short initial discussion of aesthetics, and a few perceptual principles (V.S. Ramahandran\u2019s 10 rules, Gestalt psychology, and brain fluency theory), we'll do an exercise and brainstorm together.\r\n\r\nAs a group we\u2019ll decompose known artworks \u00a0from Malevich to Mehretu and try to predict at what point in the recomposition the assemblage of material tips over into the aesthetic. The scientist would want to ask is this judgment universal or highly subjective? Can we make some assumptions about when composition lifts out of the non-aesthetic and become part of this other realm, that people more or less agree to call art. Also, what are the axes that aesthetics moves on? Can these be predictably manipulated to produce different qualities of art?\r\n\r\n___________________________________\r\n\r\nSome links from session discussion below (2-3MB files)-- ppt is available if anyone wants, just email me. -- Laurie\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/ITP_Camp_6_15_2010_part1.pdf\">ITP_Camp_6_15_2010_part1<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/ITP_Camp_6_15_2010-part2_images.pdf\">ITP_Camp_6_15_2010 part2_images<\/a>\r\n\r\n\ufeffV.S.

What should you do when you are motivated to change a behavior in the moment?\r\n\r\nBefore you begin \u2013 remember:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>1. Only record positive \u2013 motivating statements and pictures (Positive Self-Review)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>2. Never highlight negative or degrading aspects of the self \u2013 record who you think you can be!<\/li>\r\n\t<li>3. You CAN record process as long as you end up in the place where you want to be.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nTake out your phone and audio or video record the following during those critical moments when you make the decision to change:\r\n\r\n1- WHAT DO YOU RECORD \u2013 (no more than 3-5 minutes)\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>a. What is your specific plan \u2013 be very specific \u2013 only include things in your plan that you will be able to achieve<\/li>\r\n\t<li>b. Why you want to change \u2013 this is the one area where you could discuss the consequences of not changing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>c. Show your self-performing behavior or being motivated (audio).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>d. What would you say to yourself if you were considering not changing<\/li>\r\n\t<li>e. What are the barriers and how will you deal with them when you are confronted by them (implementation intentions)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>f. Who you want to be and that if you are not feeling it today does not mean it is not real.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>g. Who is your motivator?<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n2- UPLOAD: Keep on phone or upload to closed youtube site and link via text message or email\r\n\r\n3- PLAYBACK \u2013 WHEN IS PLAYBACK\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>a. Schedule in calendar or SMS\/email to alert every two days for a week<\/li>\r\n\t<li>b. Schedule in calendar or SMS\/email to alert 2 days in next week<\/li>\r\n\t<li>c. Then once a week for 90 days.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>d.

In recent years, the open source philosophy and approach started to penetrate other areas of human endeavor, now promising to transform not just the world of bytes but also the world of atoms. What are the implications of adopting these practices of knowledge sharing and distributed development to product design and hardware? What happens when everyone has access to digital fabricators and 3D scanners and parametrized models for nearly everything circulate freely on the web? While open source software has already proven itself, how can we create successful businesses for open source hardware and consumer products? Join us on this Q&amp;A session to discuss these and other open source hardware related questions.","datetime_start":1308337200000,"datetime_end":1308344400000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":755,"title":"Integrating Rhino 3D Modeling with Processing","description":"<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/ITP_011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1493\" src=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/ITP_011-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/ITP_02.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1494\" src=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/ITP_02-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/ITP_03.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1495\" src=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/ITP_03-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n3D modeling allows us to virtually examine work-in-progress from a rotational, 360-degree view, and provides crucial perspectives into identifying design flaws, visualizing aesthetic choices and drafting multiple iterations before construction or fabrication.

The military has been using these robots for years, but it has been only recently that the technology to create flying robots has become available to hobbyists.  There are several open source communities developing autonomous flying platforms.   These robots have practical uses such as aerial photography, wildlife tracking, surveillance, cartography and just pure fun to fly.\r\n\r\nWe'll show you how to get started in building a flying robot. We will go over different open source platforms. Find the best approach for building a drone for specific applications.

It's more an un-tournament, being organized as an ad hoc follow-on to my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/?p=942\" target=\"_blank\">session on games<\/a> this past Sunday. EVERYONE'S WELCOME and no need to have come to that session to enjoy the tournament.)\r\n\r\nPlease sign up\u00a0below. It will be very helpful for planning to know how many people are coming.\r\n\r\nThere will be around 10 games of all sorts, some physical, some strategic, some fast-paced, some artistic, some social, some solitary. All games will all be accesible and easy-to-learn on the spot. You can also come a bit early to practice if you want (and only if you want). NO EXPERIENCE WITH ANY OF THE GAMES NEEDED.\r\n\r\nThe better you do in each game, the more tournament point you'll earn. We'll keep a running tally on a wall of how everyone's doing and in the end give our various prizes (e.g. best at strategy games, best at physical games, etc.) and of course a Grand Prize for being the best overall.\r\n\r\nTo make it more competitive, we'll try some handicapping based on player's general level of experience (starting from \"none\") with the games, and we'll also have a tournament scoring formula that, for instance, ignores the 2 or 3 worst scores on individual games you got.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tournament, we'll spend some time talking about the experience, referencing the different game platforms, game mechanics, social mechanics, and types of fun discussed at last Sunday's session. Again, no worries if you didn't come to the session; it will all still make sense and be educational.\r\n\r\nFinally, hopefully we can get someone to take some photos and videos of highlights during the afternoon, and perhaps someone can DJ some music. And we'll see about beer and snacks.\r\n\r\nHere's the tentative game-plan, subject to revision.\r\n\r\nAs an ice-breaker, we'll start with a group party game called Mafia:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mafia_(party_game)\" target=\"_blank\">Mafia<\/a> - the classic party game of social persuasion and acting in which everyone plays together. You are either a mafia member or a townsperson. Each \"night\" someone gets secretly killed by the mafia. The townpeople then debate who to kill in return for being a suspected mafia member. The longer you live, the more tournament points you get. If you've never played, you are in for a psychological treat.\r\n\r\nThen we'll have a series of small group games:\r\n\r\n2. Scrabble - 4 players at a time. The normal word-tile game, except with a chess-style timer to keep things moving along. Play multiple times with different opponents as time allows. The more Scrabble points you get, the more tournament points you get.\r\n\r\n3.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stratego\" target=\"_blank\">Stratego<\/a> (the Barrage of \"speed\" version) - a face-paced version of Stratego, a classic 1-on-1 board game simulating two armies fighting each other. Easy to learn, hard to master.\r\n\r\n4.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/harbor-master\/id313014213?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Harbor Master<\/a> - a top-selling \"casual game\" for iPad. You are the harbor master and have to make sure the ships unload their cargo without crashing. It's a at times calm, at times frantic game of \"attention management\". Use the wonderfully intuitive touch interface to draw routes for ships, shoot the attacking pirates, and kill the giant squid. If time allows, we'll play single player and two people cooperating at a time. Also we'll project the image on a large screen for spectator enjoyment.\r\n\r\n5.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=bomberman&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=diABTtu7KYn2gAf8w4T-DQ&amp;ved=0CF8QsAQ&amp;biw=963&amp;bih=810\" target=\"_blank\">Bomberman<\/a> - a classic dead simple but completely engrossing multiplayer game where everyone is trying to blow up everyone else. 4 players at a time. Last person standing wins. Great fun, and great to watch also.\r\n\r\nWe'll also have a few 1 player games:\r\n\r\n6. Clock - a mesmerizing, abstractly beautiful game of concentration and hand-eye coordination by game designer Luke O'Conner. Featured at NYU Game Center's recent No Quarter exhibition of indie games, for which it was commissioned. Takes a minute to play but totally addictive and you'll want to keep playing to get it right.\r\n\r\n7.<a href=\"http:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/camp2011\/?p=1528\" target=\"_blank\"> Whac-a-Wall<\/a> - my ITP Camp 1-in-1 project! Like Whac-a-Mole but on a wall, using Kinect for motion detection. See how many critters you can whack in a minute. Involves jumping and waving your arms around and getting maniacally laughed at when you miss (or when my calibration is off...)\r\n\r\n8. Passage + reflections on Passage. Passage is a 5-minute \"art game\" by noted indie game designer Jason Rohrer (see\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.esquire.com\/features\/best-and-brightest-2008\/future-of-video-game-design-1208-2\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a> Esquire magazine profile). Be warned, this surprising little game might make you cry. The contest is this tournament isn't to cry the most, but to express your thoughts and feelings in the most compelling way after you play. We'll put the game in a separate room and give you some time to write or draw some post-play thoughts. Then everyone will vote on the thoughts and you get tournament points based on these votes.\r\n\r\nFor a note of randomness, we'll have:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n9.<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pass_the_Pigs\" target=\"_blank\"> Pass the Pigs<\/a>. A game of complete chance that you can't stop playing once you get in the mood. Good dumb fun -- or deep philosophical truth?\r\n\r\nAnd finally, to end the festivities, we'll play:\r\n\r\n10. Ping Pong -- Around the World! We might be able to get a full-sized ping pong table onto the floor so we can play. One idea is to end the tournament with the group game variant of Ping Pong called \"Around the World\". Everyone runs around and around the table hitting the ball back and forth. You get eliminated from the rotation if you miss. Last person to survive wins. Watch\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gQdqBMC8Q5Q&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">this <\/a>for an idea of how it works.\r\n\r\nThe exact plan will evolve over the coming week. Please share suggestions, ideas, and requests.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tournament, we'll hand out prizes and see what we've learned after an afternoon that will hopefully have been a lot of fun together.\r\n\r\nAgain, please sign up below so I know how many people to plan for, or email me. Also if you want help with video\/photos, DJ'ing, keeping score, or whatever, that'd be much appreciated!\r\n","datetime_start":1309100400000,"datetime_end":1309111200000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":2524,"title":"Proclipsing: Processing + Eclipse","description":"The Processing Development Environment is\u00a0 a great way to get started programming, but there are other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that have features that make coding and debugging much easier.\u00a0 One such IDE is Eclipse, the popular free and open source Java standard.\u00a0 Though powerful, Eclipse can take some getting used to, as the number of tools, functions, and GUI elements can be confusing.\u00a0 Proclipsing is a plugin for Eclipse that simplifies the basics of creating a Processing Project in Eclipse and exporting them.\u00a0 This session will discuss how to install Eclipse, add Proclipsing to it, and start taking advantage of the features of Eclipse to write code better and faster.","datetime_start":1309370400000,"datetime_end":1309379400000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":2524,"title":"Proclipsing: Processing + Eclipse","description":"The Processing Development Environment is\u00a0 a great way to get started programming, but there are other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that have features that make coding and debugging much easier.\u00a0 One such IDE is Eclipse, the popular free and open source Java standard.\u00a0 Though powerful, Eclipse can take some getting used to, as the number of tools, functions, and GUI elements can be confusing.\u00a0 Proclipsing is a plugin for Eclipse that simplifies the basics of creating a Processing Project in Eclipse and exporting them.\u00a0 This session will discuss how to install Eclipse, add Proclipsing to it, and start taking advantage of the features of Eclipse to write code better and faster.","datetime_start":1309003200000,"datetime_end":1309012200000,"tag_list":[],"location_name":"unknown"},{"year":2011,"id":2540,"title":"Get Your Hands Dirty!

For the host\/cook, it is a chance to not only create a social hub but to express oneself through the food that is prepared and served to guests. Sous Vide and Acvita (Meat Glue) are force multipliers that can dramatically amplify the size, scope, and level of creativity behind the dinner parties that you throw. This session will introduce both techniques and explain how you can use them to throw kick ass dinners for your friends.\r\n\r\nSous vide cooking means cooking under vacuum, typically with the help of an immersion circulator, which is a high precision water temperature regulator. Learn the basics of how to use a vacuum sealer and an immersion circulator to create an incredibly wide range of foods. I will introduce the basic methods to cook with sous vide, display a few examples of sous vide recipes, discuss safety, and how you can create\/hack your own sous vide setup at home.\r\n\r\nAlso up for discussion is an introduction to Activa, affectionately known in culinary circles as \"meat glue.\" Activa is an enzyme that binds proteins together and can be used to make novel gastronomic delights. It also plays a synergistic role with sous vide techniques and its usage will be integrated into the sous vide tutorial.\r\n\r\nBio: Mike Lee is the founder and chef of Studiofeast, an invitation only dining collective based in NYC.

The chatter of our minds is going a mile a minute to no avail. When we really need our creative muse to show up, she somehow has the uncanny ability to hide like a needle in a haystack and then show up at 3:00am as we bolt upright out of bed, making our way in the dark to scribble down the ideas she's handed to us. For too long we've accepted that's just the way creativity and imagination work - unpredictably.\r\n\r\nYoga - physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation - helps us tap into our imaginations at will and with ease, exactly when we need them. A regular yoga practice keeps our minds sharp, helps us make connections between seemingly disparate bits of information that may otherwise go unnoticed, and causes us to imagine solutions to complex challenges. By learning to quiet the mind, we give our greatest ideas the chance to rise to the top. Yoga gives us a way forward.\r\n\r\nThis session will provide a sample class geared toward enhancing creativity. It will include a few basic standing postures that can be done in your everyday clothes. The breathing and meditation techniques will all be practiced seated. It is helpful for everyone who needs to tap into their own creativity on a regular basis - from performers to programmers, in all mediums.

We have also been working with the camp staff to see how best to purchase and source parts for a large group (i.e., purchasing it all at once and collecting funds from interested parties).

This workshop is going to blitz through the API giving you a good overview of its capabilities so that you can start to envision projects, concepts and artworks through C4. After this workshop you\u2019ll have the chops to dig into the API, navigate our site\u2019s 215 code examples and 30 in-depth tutorials, ask questions on the C4 \/ StackOverflow forum and grab code from the various GitHub accounts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.c4ios.com\/\">http:\/\/www.c4ios.com<\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong><strong>------------------------<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Things you need:\r\n<\/strong>If you want to be building iOS apps you should bring a Mac with the latest version of Xcode installed.

This board has the heart of an Arduino Leonardo attached to a WiFi-equipped Linux processor.\r\n\r\nThe Y\u00fan\u00a0(which means cloud in Chinese) was developed this new board in conjunction with Hong Kong electronics manufacturer Dog Hunter, and is designed to give you the simplicity of Arduino, combined with the power of \u00a0WiFi and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/openwrt.org\/\">OpenWRT<\/a>\u00a0Linux distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Y\u00fan isn't due for release until later in June, but in this session, I'll give you a sneak peek at the\u00a0Y\u00fan and show you what it's capable of.\r\n\r\nMost Arduino users are familiar with how to connect an Arduino to another computer via the Serial port, and the Y\u00fan builds on that mental model, using a new library called Bridge.

While Perich's work aims to integrate low-level computation with traditional artistic media, this workshop intends to teach a basic understanding of Assembly, a low-level programming language that drives most hardware at its foundation. The workshop is intended for those with a basic understanding of computer programming, though it is not necessary.

He was hooked, spending hours writing video games, music programs, and simple forms of artificial intelligence. The obsession stuck with him, even as he went to the University of Toronto to study poetry and political science. When he became a magazine writer in the 1990s, the Internet erupted into the mainstream, and he began reporting on how digital tools\u00e2\u20ac\u201deverything from email to digital photography to instant messaging\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas changing society.\r\n\r\nClive started out pessimistic about the impact of the Internet on life. He worried, like many social critics before him, that society and civility would fall off a cliff. But over the next twenty years he realized that when everyday people were given remarkable powers of self-expression on a global scale, amazing things happened more often than not: Wikipedia, YouTube \u00e2\u20ac\u0153response\u00e2\u20ac\u009d conversations, collaborative art, crazy new forms of writing like TV recaps, collaborative problem-solving, and the ESP-like awareness that comes from the status-update universe.\r\n\r\nToday, Thompson is one of the most prominent technology writers, respected for doing deeply-reported, long-form magazine stories that get beyond headlines and harness the insights of science, literature, history and philosophy. He specializes in writing not merely on the inventors of technologies, but about how everyday people use them\u00e2\u20ac\u201doften quite unpredictably.

From signage to our daily budget, we use it to understand simple to complex pieces of information in an easy-to-read format. However, it's real potential lies in its ability to reveal new information and understanding of everyday data. It is a way to highlight things differently. This increased understanding provides new points of view that can be inventive, shocking, and even transformative. From the National Geographic to Washington Post, to Nicholas Felton and Giorgia Lupi, \"dataviz\" is an important tool & contemporary weapon of mass information.\r\n\r\nThis extended workshop provides the opportunity to dive into the specifics of data visualization today, and does so in two different\/complementary forms: digital and physical. The basic idea of the workshop is: turning data into matter. Information is immaterial. What happens when we transform data into something physical, something we can see, touch, feel and hold in our hands? There is more than one way to get there: we can focus on explaining the data, making something invisible visible, or we might go for a more artistic approach, depending on each participant's interests.\r\n\r\nWorkshop outline:\r\n\r\nWe will start with the basic fundamentals, historic evolution, commercial and artistic approaches, various data collection methods, showing examples from science, journalism and the arts.\r\nThen we will each define our general subjects of interest. We'll be using JC's method map from last year's fellow presentation to bridge the gap between idea and execution. We also have some suggestions for a common topic that we could explore as a group.\r\nThen it's time to venture out into the world and collect data.  We will show participants that they can use either analog or digital tools, such as pen and paper, smart phone apps, open data, etc.\r\nNext we'll show how we might turn data into a physical object. The goal is to produce a physical representation of our data visualization using digital or analog fabrication, based on preference.\r\nThe final goal is an exhibition of our work.\r\n\r\nSchedule:\r\n\r\nSession 1: introduction to the field and the workshop\r\nSession 2: project ideation\r\nSession 3: collecting data + shopping for materials\r\nSession 4: teaching digital and analog production tools\r\nSession 5: finalizing + presenting results\r\n\r\nExpected audience:\r\n\r\nOpen to anyone.

From signage to our daily budget, we use it to understand simple to complex pieces of information in an easy-to-read format. However, it's real potential lies in its ability to reveal new information and understanding of everyday data. It is a way to highlight things differently. This increased understanding provides new points of view that can be inventive, shocking, and even transformative. From the National Geographic to Washington Post, to Nicholas Felton and Giorgia Lupi, \"dataviz\" is an important tool & contemporary weapon of mass information.\r\n\r\nThis extended workshop provides the opportunity to dive into the specifics of data visualization today, and does so in two different\/complementary forms: digital and physical. The basic idea of the workshop is: turning data into matter. Information is immaterial. What happens when we transform data into something physical, something we can see, touch, feel and hold in our hands? There is more than one way to get there: we can focus on explaining the data, making something invisible visible, or we might go for a more artistic approach, depending on each participant's interests.\r\n\r\nWorkshop outline:\r\n\r\nWe will start with the basic fundamentals, historic evolution, commercial and artistic approaches, various data collection methods, showing examples from science, journalism and the arts.\r\nThen we will each define our general subjects of interest. We'll be using JC's method map from last year's fellow presentation to bridge the gap between idea and execution. We also have some suggestions for a common topic that we could explore as a group.\r\nThen it's time to venture out into the world and collect data.  We will show participants that they can use either analog or digital tools, such as pen and paper, smart phone apps, open data, etc.\r\nNext we'll show how we might turn data into a physical object. The goal is to produce a physical representation of our data visualization using digital or analog fabrication, based on preference.\r\nThe final goal is an exhibition of our work.\r\n\r\nSchedule:\r\n\r\nSession 1: introduction to the field and the workshop\r\nSession 2: project ideation\r\nSession 3: collecting data + shopping for materials\r\nSession 4: teaching digital and analog production tools\r\nSession 5: finalizing + presenting results\r\n\r\nExpected audience:\r\n\r\nOpen to anyone. No technical knowledge or coding skills required.

While in New York, Hansen was a long-standing visiting researcher at the New York Times R&D Lab and a consultant with HBO Sports. Hansen works with data in an essentially journalistic practice, crafting stories through algorithm, computation and visualization. In addition to his technical work, Hansen also has an active art practice involving the presentation of data for the public. His work with Ben Rubin at EAR Studio has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Whitney Museum, the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, the London Science Museum, the Cartier Foundation in Paris, and the lobby of the New York Times building (permanent display) in Manhattan.

And we can talk about transparency, privacy and what it might all mean.\r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been experimenting with a future where everything about us can be instantly measured and significantly added to my daily regimen to develop a patterned vocabulary and language for self-tracking. Steps walked, calories expended, weight, sleep cycles, time-online, activities, location, daily mood, micro-journal of food ingested are all part of my daily tracking -- simple and easy to collect using iphones and gadgets that point toward a time where complete self-surveillance is the norm. My current motto about self-tracking data is \"don't hide...get more\".\r\n\r\nTableau is amazing for doing really fast 'what-if' on massive amounts of excel data for both numerical and content type data. You can run Tableau public on a virtual environment or Windows.

The processes we will review are practical steps to help bring a chaotic dream into an ordered reality. I have done a number of hardware, software, and sculptural projects that use some of these elements. \r\n\r\n**Class Outline** \r\n---\r\nFirst Half\r\n---\r\n*Processes:*\r\n\r\n * Centered Problem Solving\r\n\r\n * Project Diagrams\r\n\r\n * Technical Specification  \r\n\r\n * Flow Diagram\r\n\r\n * Material Resourcing\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nBreak: 10min \r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\nSecond Half\r\n---\r\n*Software:*\r\n\r\n   * Sketch - 2D interfaces\r\n\r\n   * SketchUp - 3D printing \r\n\r\n   * Illustrator - Laser Cutting\r\n\r\n*Resources:*\r\n\r\n* 3D Warehouse\r\n\r\n* Data Resources: Data.gov and how to unearth the data you want.\r\n\r\n---\r\nClass Details\r\n---\r\n**Centered Problem Solving** is the method of putting yourself in another person's shoes so you understand what causes them pain and what makes them happy. This process will look at how you solve problems for people you've never met. The best way to do this is by talking to people, doing second hand research, and being open to surprises. You will be wrong sometimes, do be prepared to throwing your ideas away and be wrong early. \r\n\r\nP.S. Don't be anthropocentric, these principle can be used to solve problems for animals, plants, the climate or whatever. It is a centered approach to thinking.\r\n\r\n**Project Diagrams** look at encapsulated constituent components and connects them in a logical way. For instance, a new pair of shoes need shoe laces, socks, and the shoe bodies. How do we fit them together to make something awesome? This illustrates how the parts make a whole.\r\n\r\n**Tech Specs** analyzes what aspects of a component are required to work for the project. The shoe laces must be 12in for dress shoes, but 26in for lace up boots. What color, what material, what thickness etc? The wrong size screw can hold a project up for hours, a missing sensor for days, an unknown variable for weeks. Plan ahead! \r\n\r\n**Flow Diagram** think about how your project lives in the real world. Are your shoes on display? Are they in a production line for 10,000 units? Are they going to space? This process looks at how the project fits into the real world.\r\n\r\n**Resource Acquisition** is the art of collecting the appropriate elements to execute you vision. Where do I get the leather for the shell of the shoes? Where do I find the 3D printer with the right material to print the sole? Where do I find aluminum sheeting for the aglets on my shoe laces? This part I affectionately call enphysication - making your dream a reality. In software, this is finding the frameworks, libraries, and people you need to make the project.\r\n\r\nThis will be covered in a way generic enough to apply to Software, Hardware, and Sculpture, or whatever you can imagine. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Half of the class will look at the best programs and resources I have found to execute my designs and communicate my vision. These programs help fill in the gaps that sketching and concepting miss. The more you translate your physical designs to digital assets the easier it is to document, reuse, and communicate your ideas.\r\n\r\nPhysical drawing are wonderful, but you can only ever have one copy, and you can't undo changes. Whiteboarding is cool, but only people drawing with you at the time will understand the images.\r\n\r\nThis is how we make order from imagination. I look forward to sharing my process with you. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJames W.

With a little bit of effort, these machine listening techniques can be applied so that the content of the signal directly controls parameters of a transformation - akin to a bunch of people listening to a guitarist and turning the knobs on their pedals, so that the effects closely follow aspects of the playing.

In his recent Maker Faire Bay Area talk, Chris Anderson singled out this new field as of particular interest to makers right now -- let's take a look at where things are so far and where they are going next!","datetime_start":"2015-06-10 19:00:00","datetime_end":"2015-06-10 21:00:00","tag_list":["electronics","circuits","CNC","desktop","dPCB","PCB art","workshop","experimenting"],"location_name":"Soft Lab"},{"year":2015,"id":211,"title":"Search High and Low","description":"> _\"Leverett is a little better.

It will be helpful to have some experience with JavaScript, as well as CSS, HTML and SVG as they live in web pages.

The OpenGL implementation in Max holds enormous creative potential for campers interested in using node-based programming to build creative coding experiences.\r\n\r\nThe session will start with a quick and dirty introduction to Max itself, and move quickly through the following topics as needed:\r\n\r\n- The structure of an OpenGL world in Max\r\n- Basic object drawing and manipulation\r\n- Generative shape creation with jit.gl.mesh\r\n- Texture manipulation with Jitter Gen\r\n- Flocks of shapes with jit.gl.multiple\r\n- Exporting to Syphon (and thus the world)\r\n\r\nOn the way, there will be some work with generative audio, a lot of attention to visual feedback, some bizarre controllers and a great deal of profanity.\r\n\r\nNOTE FROM DAY BEFORE:\r\n\r\nHello everyone! I am looking forward to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class.\r\n\r\nFour hours is a drop in the bucket when it comes to this stuff. I want to hit the ground running, and move fast. So here are a few ways that we can grease the wheels.\r\n\r\n1) Download and install Max. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think, just do it. Make a Cycling74 account so you can register the demo. This will, no joke, save us fifteen minutes at the start of the session. If you have already popped the Max demo and it has expired, do yourself a favor and drop $13 ($10 if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got an academic ID) on a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license.  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want the 64bit version of Max 7, appropriate for your platform. Please note that those of you using Chromebooks or some other kind of non-OS X \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnix flavor will *not* be able to play along. Sorry!\r\n\r\n2) Play with it. Really! Open some tutorials, get a sense of Max\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workflow: top down, left to right. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to work on this a little, but I guarantee it will take a little bit of time to click. Be confused; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first step towards understanding.\r\n\r\n3) Bring a sensor. Those of you with Arduino projects will want to bring them. Those of you with weird sensors in hand that have some kind of driver that works with your machine will benefit greatly from this session. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mac-compatible, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll even work it into the session if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weird enough.\r\n\r\n4) Bring patches you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to spend the last hour of the session as a Max clinic, working with the patches that campers bring in. \r\n\r\n5) Bring questions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to run out of pre-prepared material around the end of hour two; this is deliberate. I want this to be as useful as possible, and merely going down my own rabbit hole will do little of value for campers who are stuck in holes of their design. \r\n\r\nIn general, be prepared to speak up and complain if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand something. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really downloaded and launched and registered it, after that there are very few questions that will annoy me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taught this stuff for a long time and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to answer any and all questions once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve passed the initial hurdle. \r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very excited for this session and humbled to have thirty RSVPs.

Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States of America is a xenophobe, racist, misogynist, bully and con artist. He has been compared to demagogues and elected strongmen. Trump has also shown himself to be a blatant liar who enjoys creating and promoting conspiracy theories. He has support from white supremacist groups. Trump has proven himself to be a master manipulator of the media and he so far has generated over $2 billion worth of free media, exponentially more than any other candidate. http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1U4o1Ef Television networks and other media channels have unfairly provided Trump with unequal amounts of airtime and news coverage. Trump is an active user of social channels like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\r\n\r\nTrump is a divider, not a uniter of people. His discourse and outrageous promises have reduced our civility. Most GOP politicians are shocked that Trump is their nominee. Many Republicans even though they said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never support Trump have quickly fallen in line. Other Republican party members are actively looking for alternatives.\r\n\r\nGOAL\r\n\r\nI believe Trump needs to be exposed in everyway possible, his support and ratings diminished.  To achieve this, average citizens must stand up and have their voices heard. This is also an urgent need as time is working against us.

Constructing the reality to put in front of a camera is still an undertaking out of reach to all but a few.  If you want to then change or share something from a film you mostly have to reshoot everything.  Recent developments in 3D rendering, motion capture, depth sensing, scanning are making cinema more mutable by making it out of parts that can be changed and shared.  Gutenberg found reusable parts to free printing from the domain of scribes resulting in an explosion of knowledge in our civilization.  What can we expect from a similar democratization of cinema?  In this session we will discuss the general power of systems where you recombine parts to create a universe of meanings.

In his lifelong study of the human unconscious, Jung found that below an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal unconscious was a deeper strata he termed the \\\\\\'collective unconscious\\\\\\'.

You can think of archetypes as images, motifs, instructs and centres of energy and attraction all rolled up into one. When we watch movies, hear stories, we are watching and hearing archetypes. The original Star Wars trilogy, for example, got its cult-like status due to its successful use of archetypal motifs.

Conversely non-realtime data sonification would be running through a precompiled data set and following compositional rules set in advance in the sonification audio environment. \r\n\r\nAn example of realtime data sonification would be an audio environment that was controlled by weather data streaming in to the audio software. An example of a non-realtime data sonification could be the translation of a CSV dataset on migration paths of birds to MIDI controlled audio parameters.\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the multichannel audio studio that will be set up at ITP this week. We will have 8.2 channels of audio to play with. This will very much be an investigation of space. I invite you to ask with me, \\\"What does sonification afford that visualization doesn\\'t?\\\" What kinds of projects can be realized during the last bit of camp?

This is how things like touch lamps work, and the basic sensing in fun kits like the Makey Makey: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU)\r\n\r\nHowever, most folks tend to start their capacitive touch sensing projects using (what I consider) outdated methods. Old-fashioned captouch tends to be noisy, needing constant recalibration, and really only works well when the electronics are grounded. It also tends to give best readings on just a binary \"Touched or not\" kind of basis. Most importantly old style cap-touch tends to use a minimum of 2 wires and a big resistor to make your interaction work.\r\n\r\nUsing ADC captouch, instead frees us from so many problems, and gives us the smallest amount of materials necessary to make cool interesting sensors! Places like Hackteria started looking to this method as an improvement over the Makey Makey ([http:\/\/www.hackteria.org\/projects\/cocomake7\/](http:\/\/www.hackteria.org\/projects\/cocomake7\/)), and we can talk about the basic theory while we make them!\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL WE DO\r\n\r\nFirst we will start off building and programming our devices. Then we will move outdoors and test out and explore the touch-sensitive properties of many items in nature and public areas nearby.

Actually I have no idea who or how many people go there, but this is the third year I've organized this and it is consistently inspiring and enjoyable.'\r\n\r\n**DIRECTIONS**\r\n\r\nThank you for signing up to participate in the Coloring with Basquiat field trip. This field trip is weather dependent. Bring your crayons.\r\n\r\n(1) Check your e-mail before heading out to make sure I haven't announced any changes.\r\n\r\n(2) The meeting point is Basquiat's grave in the historic Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn. I will arrive there on Saturday around 1PM and will stay until around 2:30PM. You are welcome to arrive any time, but I encourage you to arrive earlier than later.\r\n\r\n(3) There are several entrances to Green-Wood and depending on which entrance you take the route to get to the grave is different. I recommend taking the F or G to Church Avenue Station. From there it is a short walk to the Eastern Entrance off Ft. Hamilton. The following directions are from that entrance.\r\n\r\nEnter the grounds on Ft. Hamilton Parkway near McDonald Ave. Make a left when you enter the cemetery (the road is called Border Avenue) and take it to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grape Avenue.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  When you reach the intersection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fir Avenue,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d start cutting through diagonally until you reach a row of small headstones.  \r\n\r\nThe full map is available here (ask for one at the entrance):\r\n\r\n**[Map of Green-Wood](http:\/\/www.green-wood.com\/html\/wp-content\/uploads\/apdf\/green_wood_map.pdf)**\r\n\r\nIf you get lost you can call me here: +1 (206) 683-4962\r\n\r\n(4) I recommend watching at least one of the following two films in advance. \r\n\r\nThe Radiant Child - A comprehensive documentary on Basquiat's life.

The goal of the session is to explore how study and use of AI may influence human thought processes.\r\n\r\nThis session is for people into AI, neurology, psychology, brain science, and psychedelics. It helps to have an appreciation for the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary, and Aldous Huxley.\r\n\r\n**Talk - 30 Minutes** - The session will start with a short talk on the current state of AI and its implications for the future. I will then share stories from artists & scientists working with AI on the changes they have observed in their thinking that seem related to their study. Finally I will wrap up the stories with some wild speculation to set the stage for open discussion.\r\n\r\n**Discussion - 60 Minutes** - After the talk we will open the floor for participants to share their AI related stories. We will discuss and explore the rationality and implication of the stories and see what conclusions if any we can collectively reach.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nA little over a year ago I began to come up to speed with the latest in AI. Having taken workshops at SFPC and ITP Camp on the subject I began studying the technology and experimenting with all sorts of applications. My ITP Camp project last year was a series of interactive paintings made using AI.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of intense study I began noticing changes in certain aspects of my own thinking. It seemed as if what I had learned from studying AI was influencing how my own mind functioned.\r\n\r\nA year later, AI has become a central topic of global discussion as it transforms the landscapes of countless businesses. \r\n\r\nA year later, I continue to observe significant changes in my thinking as I study the technology, and I'm increasingly hearing similar stories from other people.\r\n\r\nIn general I prefer to spend a significant amount of time synthesizing ideas around a subject before giving a talk on it. However this is an area moving so quickly that it feels necessary to begin discussion sooner than later.","datetime_start":"2017-06-25 14:00:00","datetime_end":"2017-06-25 15:30:00","tag_list":["AI","machine learning"],"location_name":"Room 50"},{"year":2017,"id":97,"title":"Revealing Migraine through Art & Science","description":"**In this session we will explore the relationship between Art & Science through the lens of Migraine.** The session is extremely relevant for anyone who suffers from Migraine, but the lessons are applicable to any discipline.\r\n\r\nMigraine is degenerative neurological condition experienced by 18% of women and 6% of men on average. While commonly discussed as a headache, Migraine is actually a very complex condition that can disrupt the brain and body in countless ways.\r\n\r\nThe past 10 years has been amazing for research on Migraine. Scientists have a comprehensive understanding of the condition and new treatments are actively in development that could significantly improve the situation for many sufferers.\r\n\r\nThat said what the scientists have found could have been discovered sooner had they considered the work of artists suffering from the condition. Artworks depicting the condition going back over a hundred years contained much of what was needed to reach the answers we have today. Yet artwork was dismissed as an input to the scientific process due to its subjective nature. \r\n\r\nMigraine is a perfect example of where the failure of Art & Science to collaborate for cultural reasons resulted directly in human suffering. My hope is that in the future it can also be an example of where Art & Science work together to quickly aid the hundreds of millions of people suffering world wide from this condition.\r\n\r\n60 minute talk followed by 30 minutes of discussion.","datetime_start":"2017-06-17 17:00:00","datetime_end":"2017-06-17 18:30:00","tag_list":["health"],"location_name":"Room 15"},{"year":2017,"id":98,"title":"Math in Code 4 Noobs","description":"Learn how to use basic trigonometry to make your p5 sketch awesome!

A meta-analysis of 69 studies into the potential maximum capacity for humans on Earth produced a point estimate of 7.7 billion. While the range of possible capacities is dramatic, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entirely reasonable to consider that we are either approaching or have already exceeded the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to support us as a species.\r\n\r\nDiscussing this topic is far more difficult than discussing topics like the environment or CO2 emissions. Considering that we as humans may need to figure out how to limit our growth to protect the planet and ourselves is fraught with challenging and difficult to consider topics that are easier avoided than considered.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will review a range of studies and referenced information on topics including overpopulation, overconsumption, and disaster capitalism.

The CAP is 20 people, because of the space required to effectively learn and have enough room to practice drills. \r\n\r\nSystema (\u00d0\u00a1\u00d0\u00b8\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u201a\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00b0, literally meaning The System) is a Russian martial art. Training includes, but is not limited to: hand-to-hand combat, grappling, knife fighting, and firearms training. (NOTE: we will be focused on the basics, and this will NOT include grappling, knife fighting or firearms, though it is really fun! ;)\r\nThis is an INTRO class to the basics of Systema to give you skills to be more safe in the world. \r\n\r\nTypical training involves drills and sparring without set kata (that most traditional martial arts have). In Systema, the goal is to free the body of tension, fill it with breath and enhance endurance, flexibility, and effortless movement. It is a very practical martial art. \r\n\r\nKey to the philosophy of Systema, the  \"spirit\" or psychological state aims to be calm, free of anger, irritation, fear, self-pity, delusion, ego and pride.\r\n\r\nSystema has four pillars - Breathing, Relaxation, Body Position, and Movement, as well as utilizing an attacker's momentum against him and controlling the six body levers (elbows, neck, knees, waist, ankles, and shoulders) through pressure point application, striking, and weapon applications (this last part will NOT be demonstrated in this class). \r\n\r\nAs a discipline, it is becoming more and more popular among police and security forces and it is taught by several practitioners inside and outside Russia. There are multiple schools of Systema - Systema Kadochnikova, Systema Ryabko, Systema Vasiliev. I have been lucky to train with these Masters and in other schools, and would love to share the best of what I've learned! \r\n\r\nWe will go over the basics, pair up, and do group demonstrations while having a lot of fun without actually hurting anyone. (But please take this class at your own risk!) Hopefully, you will leave with a basic knowledge of Systema and some skills to use when needed.

There is over $400 million dollars currently set aside to fund innovative projects that prove the viability of decentralized web technologies. Let's put our heads together and come up with some benefits projects for humanity that utilize the creative energy which flows through itp camp.\r\nAs my primary interest in this space deals with social impact projects, I will use two projects as examples and will also feature a project of fellow itp campers developing an affordable maker space\r\nWe will use the Colony.io grant as the first example and this example grant can serve as a meta layer for any other grants as the colony Grant focuses on introducing project management and governance tools that make ad hoc collaboration possible without the risk of being left high and dry. Through the use of smart contracts and multi signature wallets, stakeholders can outline the financial terms of each grant and be sure that they will be met.\r\nThese sessions will serve as an opportunity to take a deep dive into several amazing decentralized web technology and features, and I will tailor the workshops to meet the interests of the participants as best I can.\r\n\r\nThe Colony Hackathon\r\nJune 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c June 24\r\n\r\nBuild real applications on the Colony Protocol with the colonyJS library, K\r\nBuild with the Colony Stack\r\nExtensions and Integrations\r\n\r\nProjects that connect external tools, data, and platforms we use everyday to Colony-ready dApps.\r\n\r\ndApps\r\n\r\nThe user-facing applications that enable people to interact with the Colony Network, built by developers from all around to suit the needs of their organization.\r\n\r\ncolonyJS\r\n\r\nThe bridge between the user facing and the infrastructure-facing layers of Colony.

The metal to be worked on is then grounded. The live wire is then connected to the applicator. When the applicator is applied to metal surface, wherever is not masked will be etched. The advantage of using electricity to etch metal is that it is a very predictable process. If it is desirable to have a deep etch, a higher current or longer exposure time increases the prominence of the edge. While this all can sound complicated, it can be done with just a 9-volt battery, a q-tip, alligator clips and some salty water!\r\n\r\nDuring this session we will hand-cut stencils from vinyl (you can upgrade your project by using a vinyl cutter available on the floor ahead of time for making a stencil), and practice electric etching on a scrap piece of metal I provide.

But as a movement practitioner, I wondered what the role of movement had in this new exciting world.\r\n\r\nCan machines learn movement? \r\nIf so, what can we do?\r\n\r\nAgenda\r\nToday we will accomplish the following:\r\n\r\n1. Record and label our movements using the Kinect and Processing\r\n2. Use a classifier to teach our computers how to identify our movements\r\n3. Trigger something fun with our movements!\r\n\r\nAlready feel a little lost? It's ok, just roll with it. Today is a day to try something new, make mistakes (or completely mess up), and get out of your comfort zone!
